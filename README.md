## Problem Title: SIH 25010: Smart Crop Advisory System for Small and Marginal Farmers  

## Problem Description  
Government of Punjab  
Agriculture, FoodTech & Rural Development  

## Proposed Solution  

We propose a **Smart Crop Advisory System**, delivered via a **mobile application and chatbot**, that provides **real-time, location-specific, and personalized agricultural insights** using AI and data analytics.

### Core Features:

- **Crop Selection Guidance**  
  Based on soil type, weather patterns, and crop rotation history.

- **Soil Health & Fertilizer Recommendations**  
  Input based on soil testing reports or farmer-submitted data.

- **Weather-based Alerts**  
  Predictive advisories for irrigation, pesticide spraying, and harvesting.

- **Pest & Disease Detection**  
  AI-powered image recognition system to detect crop diseases via smartphone camera.

- **Market Price Monitoring**  
  Real-time tracking of crop prices in nearby mandis.

- **Multilingual & Voice-based Interface**  
  Support for major Indian languages and voice navigation for ease of use.

- **Farmer Feedback System**  
  For continuous learning and model improvement.

## How it Addresses the Problem  

Small and marginal farmers often lack access to scientific guidance and timely information. This system delivers **personalized support directly to their smartphones**, enabling **better decision-making** and improved **crop outcomes**. Real-time alerts and data-driven recommendations empower farmers to act proactively.

## Innovation and Uniqueness  

- Combines **AI-powered disease detection**, **market analysis**, and **localized advisories** in a single app.
- Provides **voice support and regional language integration** for inclusive access.
- Offers a **feedback loop** for continuous improvement based on user inputs.

## Technical Approach  

### Technologies to be Used:

- **Frontend:** React Native / Flutter (for cross-platform mobile development)  
- **Backend:** Node.js / Django  
- **Database:** Firebase / PostgreSQL  
- **AI/ML Models:** TensorFlow / PyTorch for image classification and predictive analytics  
- **Weather API:** Integration with IMD or OpenWeatherMap  
- **Language Support:** Google Cloud Text-to-Speech, Bhashini API for regional language support  

### Methodology and Process for Implementation:

1. **Phase 1:** Requirements gathering, stakeholder interviews, and design mockups  
2. **Phase 2:** Development of core modules (crop advisory, soil input, weather integration)  
3. **Phase 3:** AI model training for pest/disease detection  
4. **Phase 4:** Testing and deployment of multilingual voice interface  
5. **Phase 5:** Field testing with farmers and feedback incorporation  

*Flowcharts, system architecture diagrams, and UI prototypes will be provided in supplementary documents.*

## Feasibility and Viability  

### Technical Feasibility

- Uses accessible technologies like smartphones, GPS, cloud computing, and AI/ML.
- High rural smartphone penetration and mobile internet coverage.
- Open-source tools and APIs reduce time and development costs.

### Operational Feasibility

- **Language & Literacy Support:** Voice-enabled UI and multilingual support.  
- **Ease of Use:** Designed for users with minimal digital literacy.  
- **Field Support:** Collaboration with local NGOs, cooperatives, and extension workers.

## Potential Challenges and Risks  

- Limited digital literacy in rural areas  
- Unstable or low mobile network connectivity  
- Resistance to adopting new digital tools  

## Strategies for Overcoming These Challenges  

- Organize **digital literacy workshops** and demos with local partners  
- Implement **offline-first features** with data sync  
- Build **trust through pilot implementations** and early success stories  

## Impact and Benefits  

### Potential Impact on the Target Audience

- Empowers farmers with **real-time, personalized crop and farming advice**  
- Helps increase **crop yield**, reduce **input costs**, and improve **income**  
- Bridges the digital divide with **voice and regional language support**  
- Promotes **sustainable and eco-friendly farming**

### Benefits of the Solution

- **Social:** Enhances access to agricultural knowledge  
- **Economic:** Improves farmer profitability and market access  
- **Environmental:** Encourages judicious use of water, fertilizers, and pesticides
