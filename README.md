## Problem Title
SIH 25010: Smart Crop Advisory System for Small and Marginal Farmers
## Problem Description
A majority of small and marginal farmers in India rely on traditional knowledge, local shopkeepers, or guesswork for crop selection, pest control, and fertilizer use. They lack access to personalized, real-time advisory services that account for soil type, weather conditions, and crop history. This often leads to poor yield, excessive input costs, and environmental degradation due to overuse of chemicals. Language barriers, low digital literacy, and absence of localized tools further limit their access to modern agri-tech resources.

Impact / Why this problem needs to be solved

Helping small farmers make informed decisions can significantly increase productivity, reduce costs, and improve livelihoods. It also contributes to sustainable farming practices, food security, and environmental conservation. A smart advisory solution can empower farmers with scientific insights in their native language and reduce dependency on unreliable third-party advice.

Expected Outcomes

• A multilingual, AI-based mobile app or chatbot that provides real-time, location-specific crop advisory.
• Soil health recommendations and fertilizer guidance.
• Weather-based alerts and predictive insights.
• Pest/disease detection via image uploads.
• Market price tracking.
• Voice support for low-literate users.
• Feedback and usage data collection for continuous improvement.

Relevant Stakeholders / Beneficiaries

• Small and marginal farmers
• Agricultural extension officers
• Government agriculture departments
• NGOs and cooperatives
• Agri-tech startups

Supporting Data

• 86% of Indian farmers are small or marginal (NABARD Report, 2022).
• Studies show ICT-based advisories can increase crop yield by 20–30%.

## Proposed Solution
<ul><li>Detailed explanation of the proposed solution
                         We propose a Smart Crop Advisory System, delivered via a mobile application and chatbot, that provides real-time, location-specific, and personalized agricultural insights using AI and data analytics.
Core Features:

Crop Selection Guidance
Based on soil type, weather patterns, and crop rotation history.

Soil Health & Fertilizer Recommendations
Input based on soil testing reports or farmer-submitted data.

Weather-based Alerts
Predictive advisories for irrigation, pesticide spraying, and harvesting.

Pest & Disease Detection
AI-powered image recognition system to detect crop diseases via smartphone camera.

Market Price Monitoring
Real-time tracking of crop prices in nearby mandis.

Multilingual & Voice-based Interface
Support for major Indian languages and voice navigation for ease of use.

Farmer Feedback System
For continuous learning and model improvement.

<li>Methodology and process for implementation <b>(Flow Charts/Images/ working prototype)</b></li></ul>

## Feasibility and Viability
<ul><li>Analysis of the feasibility of the idea
Technical Feasibility

The proposed solution leverages widely available technologies such as smartphones, cloud computing, AI/ML models, and GPS-based services. These technologies are proven, scalable, and cost-effective. Most rural areas now have access to basic mobile networks, and smartphone penetration is steadily increasing among small and marginal farmers.

Core components like crop advisory systems, image-based disease detection, and voice interfaces can be developed using existing frameworks and open-source tools, reducing development time and cost.

Operational Feasibility

Language and Literacy Support: The app will support regional languages and include voice-based interactions to ensure accessibility for users with low literacy levels.

Ease of Use: A simple, intuitive user interface will be designed to ensure minimal training is required for farmers to operate the app.

Field Support: Partnerships with local NGOs, agricultural extension workers, and cooperatives can help bridge the digital divide and support on-ground implementation.
