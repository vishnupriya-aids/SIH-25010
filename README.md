## Problem Title
SIH 25010: Smart Crop Advisory System for Small and Marginal Farmers
## Problem Description
A majority of small and marginal farmers in India rely on traditional knowledge, local shopkeepers, or guesswork for crop selection, pest control, and fertilizer use. They lack access to personalized, real-time advisory services that account for soil type, weather conditions, and crop history. This often leads to poor yield, excessive input costs, and environmental degradation due to overuse of chemicals. Language barriers, low digital literacy, and absence of localized tools further limit their access to modern agri-tech resources.

Impact / Why this problem needs to be solved

Helping small farmers make informed decisions can significantly increase productivity, reduce costs, and improve livelihoods. It also contributes to sustainable farming practices, food security, and environmental conservation. A smart advisory solution can empower farmers with scientific insights in their native language and reduce dependency on unreliable third-party advice.

Expected Outcomes

• A multilingual, AI-based mobile app or chatbot that provides real-time, location-specific crop advisory.
• Soil health recommendations and fertilizer guidance.
• Weather-based alerts and predictive insights.
• Pest/disease detection via image uploads.
• Market price tracking.
• Voice support for low-literate users.
• Feedback and usage data collection for continuous improvement.

Relevant Stakeholders / Beneficiaries

• Small and marginal farmers
• Agricultural extension officers
• Government agriculture departments
• NGOs and cooperatives
• Agri-tech startups

Supporting Data

• 86% of Indian farmers are small or marginal (NABARD Report, 2022).
• Studies show ICT-based advisories can increase crop yield by 20–30%.

## Proposed Solution
<h3>GRAMSEVA AGRICULTURE</h3>
<ul><li>Detailed explanation of the proposed solution
Gramseva Agriculture will be a smart, AI-driven advisory platform available as a mobile app and chatbot. Key features include:

AI-Powered Crop Recommendations: Based on local climate, soil data, and past crop cycles.

Soil Health & Fertilizer Guidance: Integrates with soil test reports or user input to recommend correct fertilizer types and dosages.

Pest & Disease Detection: Farmers upload photos of affected crops; AI model identifies issue and suggests remedy.

Market Linkages: Real-time crop price tracking from nearby mandis and eNAM.

Weather Forecasting & Alerts: Provides early warnings for rain, drought, or extreme weather.

Voice & Vernacular Support: Speech-to-text and voice playback in regional languages for accessibility.

Offline Access: Key features accessible without active internet connection

## Technical Approach
<ul><li>Technologies to be used (e.g. programming languages, frameworks, hardware)
  The implementation would likely involve a combination of technologies:

Backend: Cloud-based infrastructure (e.g., AWS, Azure) to handle data processing and AI models.

Frontend: A mobile app (Android/iOS) developed using frameworks like React Native or Flutter for cross-platform compatibility.

AI/ML: Machine learning models for image recognition (for pest/disease detection), predictive analytics (for weather and market trends), and natural language processing (NLP) for voice support and chatbot functionality.

Data: Integration with weather APIs, agricultural databases, and market price data sources.

## Feasibility and Viability
<ul><li>Analysis of the feasibility of the idea
The project is feasible due to the increasing penetration of smartphones and mobile data in rural India. The primary challenges would be:

Ensuring data accuracy: The system's effectiveness depends on reliable weather, soil, and market data.

User adoption: Overcoming low digital literacy and encouraging trust in an automated system will require a strong user-friendly design and potential on-ground support from agricultural extension officers.

Technical challenges: Developing a robust AI model for pest detection and an effective multilingual voice-based interface can be complex.
